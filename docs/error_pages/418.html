    <h1>I'm a teapot</h1>
    <p>This server is a teapot, and it cannot brew coffee.</p>
    <p>There is coffee all over the world. Increasingly, in a world in which
        computing is ubiquitous, the computists want to make coffee. Coffee
        brewing is an art, but the distributed intelligence of the web-
        connected world transcends art.  Thus, there is a strong, dark, rich
        requirement for a protocol designed espressoly for the brewing of
        coffee. Coffee is brewed using coffee pots.  Networked coffee pots
        require a control protocol if they are to be controlled.
     
        Increasingly, home and consumer devices are being connected to the
        Internet. Early networking experiments demonstrated vending devices
        connected to the Internet for status monitoring [COKE]. One of the
        first remotely _operated_ machine to be hooked up to the Internet,
        the Internet Toaster, (controlled via SNMP) was debuted in 1990
        [RFC2235].
     
        The demand for ubiquitous appliance connectivity that is causing the
        consumption of the IPv4 address space. Consumers want remote control
        of devices such as coffee pots so that they may wake up to freshly
        brewed coffee, or cause coffee to be prepared at a precise time after
        the completion of dinner preparations.</p>
