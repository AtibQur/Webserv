The server is working fine using a CGI.
The CGI should be run in the correct directory for relative path file access.
With the help of the students you should check that everything is working properly. You have to test the CGI with the "GET" and "POST" methods.
You need to test with files containing errors to see if the error handling works properly. You can use a script containing an infinite loop or an error; you are free to do whatever tests you want within the limits of acceptability that remain at your discretion. The group being evaluated should help you with this.

The server should never crash and an error should be visible in case of a problem.
